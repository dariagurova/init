The IP address of Non-authoritative answer is mostly similar but the IP address of the DNS server is different as we are resolving the name using a different DNS server(8.8.8.8).

The purpose of this question is to detect if we are getting a reply from a local server.
Hence ideally, for 42 US, it should ask to compare outputs for 42.us.org
